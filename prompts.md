Prompts give to calude sonnet 3.5 to create this.

1.

i want to make a onenote like interface where you can click anywhere on the page and type. you can also paste images. each page is infinite scrollable in any direction. Don't open prompt to type, anywhere i click on the page, i should be able to type. Don't implement this functionality using html5 canvas. Canvas is limited in text input capablilities. Use divs and CSS to implement this.
this is javascript based and runs in browser without any dependencies.
