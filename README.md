# OneNoteInBrowser

An offline HTML/Javascript clone of OneNote that runs in browser. Don't know if i will complete it or abandon midway.

Nothing serious so far (made by AIs atm inc Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4/4o). 

Not using any external libs atm but will do to ease the JS code.

# Feature goals

- Click anywhere and enter text or paste image
- Move around the text blocks
- Formatting in text blocks (markdown? will use thirdparty lib, should be easy because its just a div)
- Save everything (sqlite? localstorage? can follow https://sequencediagram.org)
- Tabs and folders
- Attach other kind of files ?
- Searching

# Not in goals

- Hand writing
